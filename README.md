# Set Up
To set up this project locally you'll need:
  * Dataset online avaialble: "/kaggle/input/customer-personality-analysis/marketing_campaign.csv"
  * All packages versions are described in requirements.txt

# Project Motivation
I decided to analyze "customer-personality-analysis" data to understand:

* How to do an exploratory data analysis from scratch?
* How to implement a K-Means clusterization?
* How to define and analyze customer profiles?
* For that end, I respond the following business question:
  * How can we personalize communications based on income and spend?
  * The fact of having children, changes consumer behaviour?
  * The fact of living alone or with a partner, changes consumer behaviour?
  * How age affects to consumer behaviour?
