# Set Up
To set up this project locally you'll need:
  * Dataset online available: "/kaggle/input/customer-personality-analysis/marketing_campaign.csv"


# Project Motivation
I decided to analyze "customer-personality-analysis" data to understand:

* How to do an exploratory data analysis from scratch?
* How to implement a K-Means clusterization?
* How to define and analyze customer profiles?
* For that end, I respond the following business question:
  * How much do customers spend by purchase, compared to their income?
  * How old are our customers? Do they have children?
  * The fact of having children, how does it affect to consumer behaviour?
 
# File Descriptions
There is 1 notebook available: customer_personality_analysis
